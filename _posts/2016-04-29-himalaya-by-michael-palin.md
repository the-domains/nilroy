Travel diary of celebrated BBC reporter Micheal E Palin. In himalaya, Micheal travels 1800 miles, starting at the Khyber Pass on the Afghanistan/Pakistan-border, passing through Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet, China, Bhutan and eventually finishing at the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh. A great armchair travel book.
